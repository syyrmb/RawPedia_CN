1. Line 3709-3712 ("I'll skip the notions of Bayer matrix, demosaicing... which involve rather complex concepts, far removed from the concerns of the artist photographer (and yet one of the key points of the digital system).")

+ This can be cross-linked directly to RawPedia's demosaicing article since we're in RawPedia already, instead of being skipped. Proposed change: If you wish to learn more about how softwares convert values from a digital sensor to an image, please read [Demosaicing](/master/content/Demosaicing/index.md).

2. Line 3720 ("originating from CIE (Commission Internationale de l'Éclairage - in French)")

+ Propose change: originating from CIE ("***C***ommission ***I***nternationale de l'***É***clairage" in French, aka International Commission on Illumination).
